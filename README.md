## Description

A repository to host code and data regarding molecular biology-related analysis with a focus on yeast strains, including growth analysis and bioinformatic pipelines. Here you will currently find some R code to analyze the growth of yeast strains, as well as various figures and `.drawio` files regarding yeast biology-centered parts of the AcubeSAT mission

## Growth Analysis

### Introduction

The conventional microbial population growth in bulk liquid medium is a very well-studied subject `[1]`. The generic four-phase pattern of a standard bacterial population growth is known as the **growth curve**. The **lag phase** is when microorganisms initially adjust to a new environment; for example when introduced into a test tube with new conditions regarding temperature, pH, sugar concentration, etc. The log or **exponential phase** is when cells start dividing regularly and the population rises rapidly, reaching maximum growth rate. As the time passes and cell density increases (in a closed system), nutrients diminish. Other changes, for example pH changes, occur due to the microbial high metabolic rates. Moreover, death rate starts increasing until it *matches* the growth rate. This phase, called **stationary phase**, is characterized by a constant living cell population. The following phase is denoted as **death phase**, which can be described as the situation whereon death rate surpasses growthrate and population declination initiates `[2]`.
### ACubeSAT example

The ACubeSAT mission will host a scientific payload, wherein a custom-made lab-on-a-chip will be situated, to allow for multiplexed cell culturing and analysis. This PDMS chip will host *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* yeast cells in spore formation. Before the first in-orbit experiment commences, the cells might remain stored inside the spacecraft for up to more than two years. To ensure the cells will still grow in a consistent and timely manner when the time comes, we probed the growth behaviour of the `TAF10-GFP MATa` strains by conducting a growth analysis on both cells and spores after 1 year of storage in RT.

### Code

To perform the growth analysis, we can use the `src/growth_analysis/growth_analysis.R` file. From there, the `growth_analysis()` function takes as **inputs**:

1. a path with a `.csv` file that has the respective **timepoints** (in the *first* column) and the **OD measurements** of the desired strains 
2. a number of **replicates** for each strain
3. user-defined values/timepoints of OD **measurements with cells in the exponential phase** (straight line in the linear model) that will be used in the linear regression model (and to calculate the maximal growth rate)

Note: Input (3) should be decided after the plotting step, *but* for convencience in our case, it can be defined here *retrospectively*.

The **outputs** are:
1. **individual** and **cumulative growth curves** (OD versus time),
2. the **linear model fit summary** and
3. **maximal growth rate/doubling time** for *each* strain.

### Example

As an example, consider conducting a growth analysis of 4 yeast strains from the Yeast GFP library (GFP-tagged TAF10, TEF2, ALG9, UBC6) with 2 replicates each:

```r
# path: /yeast-biology/src/growth_analysis/
source("growth_analysis.R") 
growth_analysis("example.csv", 2, 4:9)
```

An example `.csv` file containing the data to be parsed is `example.csv`, with contents:
